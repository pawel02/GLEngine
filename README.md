# GLEngine
I wanted to learn a little about graphics and game engines and therefore decided to learn opengl. I tried to keep the code as clean as possible however I am only begining my coding career in c++.
I have used the following libraries:
 - stbi_image (for loading images)
 - glfw (cross platform for creating windows and handling keyboard input events)
 - glad (cross platform loads all of the function pointers for opengl so)
